    <h1>Dear Aditya,</h1>
 <p>
This is a HUGE moment and I'm very glad I could make it just a tiny bit better. 
<br>
This website? 
<br>
I honestly wanted it to be perfect and I tried my best. I spent weeks searching, learning, trying to code. Then fought with ChatGPT because she couldn't explain things to me well enough. I had imagined myself in pretty clothes, with my favourite classical beats and coffee on the side while I code this.
<br><br>
I was heavily under some illusion. This is NOT how it went. I started this on 13th July at 2:38 AM. I binge watched like tons of videos of Indian Profs teaching coding online. I have developed parasocial relations with Prof. Kannan-something. He is from IIT Bombay. I watched a lot of his videos.
<br>
So what I meant to say is that, coding this website was NOT peaceful. I now have personal beef with the <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> tag (I used it a lot in the wheel).  
I hate it so much that I want it exiled from the internet forever. Every time I type in <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code>, a piece of my soul evaporates and leaves the face of this earth.
<br><br>
Oh and about the wheel..Its kind of broken. It doesnt let you spin again if you dont reset it. I seriously cannot for life figure out how to change it. I spent like days on that. But as soon as i add something in, the wheel goes all haywire and changes colours and all, and then the pointer starts to fucking move INSIDE the wheel. 
<br> 
Pls understand. I'm truly losing my mind on that Wheel
<br><br>
But, I seriously enjoyed this. Making all this from scratch healed and broke things in me. At least now I know that I truly HATE coding.
 <br>
I hope you have a good time going through this and all the other gifts. 
<br>  
I love you, okay? 
<br><br> 
Love, 
<br> 
Ruja <3
